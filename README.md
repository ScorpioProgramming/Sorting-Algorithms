# Sorting-Algorithms
The three included sorting algorithms are: Insertionsort, Mergsort and Quicksort.

In this program all of the diffrent algorithms are sorting arrays with 10, 1000 and 100000 elements. The algorithms are timed to compare
the time it took for each algorithm on each stage with the easiest being 10, medium being 1000 and hard being 100000 diffrent elements.
